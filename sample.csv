Why an HVAC Career?

Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are vital to homes and businesses across the United States. Homeowners and business owners alike need the services of skilled technicians with an HVAC license to perform reliable installation, repair, and service for their crucial systems.  Companies are looking for qualified technicians who possess an HVAC certification to meet the needs of their growing businesses.


The Department of Labor expects HVAC careers to grow at a much faster rate than other occupations.  Employers looking to fill these positions are on the hunt for certified technicians. There are a variety of opportunities available for those pursuing HVAC careers.  Various options include employment in wholesale, service, equipment manufacturing, and more. HVAC technician salary levels vary by establishment.  Join a career that can be rewarding for you and your family!


Industry Outlook:
According to the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment of heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration mechanics and installers is expected to grow 34% from 2010 to 2020.  This growth rate is exponentially higher than most other occupations.  Commercial and residential building construction will drive employment growth as the construction industry continues to recover from the 2007-09 recession. The growing number of sophisticated climate-control systems is also expected to increase demand for qualified HVAC/R technicians.


Climate-control systems generally need replacement after 10 to 15 years. A large number of recently constructed homes and commercial buildings will need replacement climate-control systems by 2020, spurring demand for technicians.


According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job opportunities for HVACR technicians are expected to be excellent, particularly for those who have completed training at an accredited technical school or through a formal apprenticeship. Candidates familiar with computers and electronics will have the best job opportunities as employers continue to have trouble finding qualified technicians to work on complex new systems.

In the Redirection program you will work with the client as well as the family in the hopes of making positive change. This position utilizes the CBT therapeutic model. CBT is focused on helping youth and families replace maladaptive coping skills, thinking, emotions and behaviors with more adaptive ones by challenging an individual&rsquo;s way of thinking and the way that he or she reacts to certain habits and behaviors. CBT challenges patterns and beliefs and replaces errors in thinking with more realistic and effective thoughts, which then decreases emotional distress and self-defeating behavior. This is an exciting and challenging opportunity to impact change with these clients and families.

Firestone Complete Auto Care is Hosting a Hiring Event for Automotive Technicians for MANY of our locations in the Chicagoland area and in surrounding cities!!

OPEN HOUSE!!!
Interview with our Region Staff!
Wednesday March 25
12:00pm to 8:00pm
Holiday Inn Countryside
6201 Joliet Road
Countryside, IL 60525

Bridgestone Retail Operations, LLC employs over 22,000 teammates in North America and operates more than 2,200 company-owned stores. The store locations include Firestone Complete Auto Care, Tires Plus, and Wheel Works. With 2,200 locations across America and over $3 billion in tire and auto service sales, Bridgestone Retail Operations is the right place to build a career.

We&rsquo;re currently hiring for all technician positions including:
&bull; Entry Level Technician
&bull; Entry Level Mechanic / Technician
&bull; Senior Mechanic / Automotive Technician
&bull; Lead Mechanic / Master Technician
Keep reading to see why we Bridgestone Retail Operations and Firestone Complete Auto Care are better for you than the competition!

We are the nation&rsquo;s largest and most advanced automotive service retailer and we&rsquo;re looking for the very best automotive techs. Our stores are full service shops and our mechanics are the lifeblood of our organization. Our full time technicians enjoy great pay and a full range of benefits including health, dental and vision insurance as well as a 401k match retirement account!

But isn&rsquo;t the car dealer the best place for top technicians? THINK AGAIN! HERE IS WHY:

Over the last few years, at a time when many dealers were closing their doors, we were experiencing tremendous growth. Our technicians enjoy a very high level of stability because our stores are not dependent on highly cyclical and unstable new car sales. At a time when many dealers were closing or experiencing management shuffle after shuffle, our technicians enjoyed job stability as we continued to open stores and experience increased service sales. We bring more stability, because our business isn&rsquo;t dependent on the volatility of new car sales! Most dealers simply can&rsquo;t offer the benefits or job stability that we can. There are quite a few automotive shops hiring today, but our technicians know they can count on us to be here TODAY and TOMORROW.

Why pay out of pocket for your ASE's?

We pay our technician&rsquo;s ASE test costs AND pay a Bonus for each that they pass!
We understand we wouldn&rsquo;t have any stores if we didn&rsquo;t employ the very best mechanics in the industry! We take pride in hiring the very best technicians, who are responsible for diagnosing, repairing and performing preventive maintenance on our customer's vehicles. Bridgestone and Firestone Complete Auto Care together with our other national brands including Tires Plus are the Biggest (fact) and BEST (our humble opinion) automotive team in the WORLD! If you have a winning attitude and would like a long term career with a great company, we are interested in speaking with you.
